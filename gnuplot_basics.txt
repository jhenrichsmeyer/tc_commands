Gnuplot is a versatile command-line plotting program.
It can be used both interactively and with plot scripts.
The most simple usage is to open gnuplot in a shell and use it interactively.
For opening gnuplot, type 'gnuplot' in a shell. This will open GNUPlots built-in shell and set a so-called "terminal:
 > behnle@south:~$ gnuplot

 >        faq, bugs, etc:   type "help FAQ"
 >        immediate help:   type "help"  (plot window: hit 'h')
 >
 > Terminal type is now 'qt'
 > gnuplot>

The terminal is the "output channel" where the plot is written to, in this case a window based on the Qt-framework. The terminal can also be a file, e.g. a .pdf file

Plotting functions is easy. If you want to plot a parabola, just enter (do NOT type  "gnuplot>", this is gnuplot's internal shell")
 > gnuplot> plot x**2
This should open a new plot window with the desiredd parabola.

Plotting data from files is also easy: Columns in files can be referenced by their column numbers. Supposed, we have a file 
#xdata  ydata
1        5
2       10  
4        5
5        7
8       10
10       7

containing a data series consisting of x and y data. We can plot the y against the x data with the command
> gnuplot> plot './data.dat' using 1:2 with linespoints
(or in shorthand notation "plot './data.dat' u 1:2 w lp")
Column 1 is used as x data, column 2 is used as y data.
The option "with linespoints" tells GNUPlot to draw data points and connect these with lines

3D plotting is done with the command "splot" which requires data triples (x/y/z value), i.e. either a function of x and y or three columns from a file.


GNUPlot has a powerful built-in help. Type "help" for opening the general help or "help <option> for help on some subtopic.
The help view can be closed by pressing "q", the subtopic selection can be closed by pressing enter.


When you are done, GNUplot can be closed with the command "quit" (or the respective shortcut "q")
